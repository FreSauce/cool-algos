# Contribution Guidelines

* Use the [GitHub issues tracker](https://github.com/nikochiko/cool-algos/issues) to suggest new changes or find tasks to work on.
* Clone the repository, make changes on your local branch and then create a pull request with those changes. Refer [this](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github) if it is your first contribution!
* The algorithms should be roughly divided into directories according to their type (e.g. Sorting, Search, etc). The naming convention should be `lower_snake_case.ext` (e.g. `Search/linear_search/linear_search.cpp`).
* Request a review from one of the maintainers (currently @nikochiko) once your PR is ready.
* The maintainers will review the PR, and suggest changes if any. Once the PR is ready to go, you will receive a LGTM (Looks good to me)! The PR is approved and will be merged shortly.

### General Notes

* Make sure to test the code yourself before pushing.
* Documentation along with contributions is appreciated, though not strictly required right now.
